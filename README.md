a lot happened in the first commit because the commit was done in class. i changed the background of the body of the page to
a parchment paper background. it is initially hidden but shown after the seal of the initial scroll is clicked on.
i added some basic html tags like ps and h1 and h2s to the index to have a basic setup of the text.
