a lot happened in the first commit because the commit was done in class. i changed the background of the body of the page to
a parchment paper background. it is initially hidden but shown after the seal of the initial scroll is clicked on.
i added some basic html tags like ps and h1 and h2s to the index to have a basic setup of the text.

mobile-first branch
 - added several breakpoints for various sized tablets and phones, as well as laptops. tried unsucessfully to have pulsation be constant on smaller screens only. but for now i just added breakpoints in the CSS file to have the scroll and seal look presentable in different viewports
